  dialog:
  - It looks like this place has been abandoned. I think it's time we stop to rest.
  - It looks a bit creepy.
  - I'm sure it's fine.
  - 'this journey is more challenging than what we prepared for. '
  - Are we sure this was a good idea?
  - It's too late to turn back.
  - I don't like this at all... We don't even know the way.
  - Stop bringing us down. You don't have to go if you don't want to.
  - You can't leave me behind. We are a team.
  - I'm starting to feel like you are just slowing me down.
